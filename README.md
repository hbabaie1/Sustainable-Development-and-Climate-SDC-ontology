# Sustainable-Development-and-Climate-SDC-ontology
The Sustainable Development and Climate (SDC) ontology represents the types and interrelations of entities that are outlined in the targets and indicators of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (U.N. SDGs) 1 (ending poverty), 2 (ending hunger), 6 (sustainable clean water and sanitation), 7 (access to affordable and clean energy), and 13 (combating climate change). The semantic model defines the complex interactions of the components of the climate and the socio-economic-environmental systems in relations to these UNSDGs in an OWL ontology, focusing on people (poverty and hunger), and planet (water, food, and energy resources, climate change) as described in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The ontology also formalizes the actions, plans, strategies, and policies that are prescribed by the U.N. SDGs and defined in their targets that are required to be implemented by the U.N. government agencies for reaching sustainability.
